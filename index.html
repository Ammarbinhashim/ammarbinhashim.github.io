                <h2>Why Mechanical Engineering?</h2>
                <p>
                  I once considered pursuing a career in Computer Science, drawn to certain aspects of it. However, I often felt a disconnect—like my curiosity hit a wall—leaving me less fulfilled by the subject. Over time, I realized my true passion lay elsewhere: in cars, bikes, machines—anything human-made that moves or makes something else move. Since childhood, I’ve been fascinated by the ingenuity of these creations, their designs, working principles, and their ability to achieve what once seemed impossible for humanity.

I wasn’t just intrigued by their function but by the challenge of understanding and simplifying complex ideas. I wanted to internalize concepts in a way that resonated with me—making the intricate seem simple, so even a novice could grasp them. For me, this was never about explaining things just for others but about keeping my own interest alive by reimagining them creatively.

While I’ve found success in this approach, I’m aware of the moments where self-doubt creeps in—particularly with topics that require persistence to master. When I asked ChatGPT how to sustain my passion, its advice resonated deeply: 'Remember why you started.'

That clarity continues to guide me. When asked in an interview why I chose this path, I want my response to reflect both my strengths and the journey I’ve taken to embrace my vulnerabilities—because they’ve made me who I am.

                  I’ve always been driven by a desire to challenge myself and understand my true potential. While campus placements are often seen as a straightforward path, I see them as a structured yet competitive environment where I can showcase my adaptability, learn from real-world hiring standards, and connect with industry leaders. My decision to participate stems from a larger goal — not just to land a job, but to stand out by continuously upgrading my skills and embracing opportunities that push me forward. I believe that to thrive in today’s fast-changing world, one must stay dynamic, and that’s the mindset I bring to every role I pursue.

                <h2>Why Prefer Core Industries?</h2>
             <p>
               I've always wanted to explore careers based on my interests which I had nurtured since my early times. As I've involved deeply into the discipline which 
               I am pursuing, I found my field of interest where I can truly test my existing skills, and develop it through stages. A challenge that I have to take will be 
               to maintain the ability to sustain my future for which I've invested my time and effort, as a rapidly changing world would no longer require a stable skillset. 
               I've seen myself in situations where taking risks was never an option, and I've been able to learn through my footprints, and being able to be surrounded by resources 
               in the form of my faculties who were able to see a potential of mine that I never saw in me, and colleagues with mutual interests that helped me push myself, and see 
               the future from a different perspective; has really convinced me that there is a hope. 
               Now, if I ever had an opportunity to go out of the box for other industries, I would do it as long as I am able to maintain my personal attributes and be able to take 
               advantage of the factors that can challenge it.
