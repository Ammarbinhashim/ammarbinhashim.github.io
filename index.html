                <h2>Why Mechanical Engineering?</h2>
                <p>
                  I once considered pursuing a career in Computer Science, drawn to certain aspects of it. However, I often felt a disconnect—like my curiosity hit a wall—leaving me less fulfilled by the subject. Over time, I realized my true passion lay elsewhere: in cars, bikes, machines—anything human-made that moves or makes something else move. Since childhood, I’ve been fascinated by the ingenuity of these creations, their designs, working principles, and their ability to achieve what once seemed impossible for humanity.

I wasn’t just intrigued by their function but by the challenge of understanding and simplifying complex ideas. I wanted to internalize concepts in a way that resonated with me—making the intricate seem simple, so even a novice could grasp them. For me, this was never about explaining things just for others but about keeping my own interest alive by reimagining them creatively.

While I’ve found success in this approach, I’m aware of the moments where self-doubt creeps in—particularly with topics that require persistence to master. When I asked ChatGPT how to sustain my passion, its advice resonated deeply: 'Remember why you started.'

That clarity continues to guide me. When asked in an interview why I chose this path, I want my response to reflect both my strengths and the journey I’ve taken to embrace my vulnerabilities—because they’ve made me who I am.

                  I’m driven by a strong desire to secure a job soon—one that allows me to save enough to fulfill a dream of exploring the remote wilderness of the Northeast. My goal is to live minimally, embracing the simplicity of nature and experiencing the freedom of the open road, ideally on a cruiser bike I’ve earned through my own hard work.

This journey isn’t about escaping but about finding peace and happiness, away from the noise of judgment. Growing up labeled unfairly by others as an outsider has shaped my resilience and deepened my determination to carve out a life on my terms. Chris McCandless’s story resonates with me, as I, too, seek meaning and fulfillment in the wild.

Equally important to me is settling the debts I owe—both financial and emotional. My father and sister have been pillars of support during challenging times, and it’s my priority to repay their kindness. Every step I take is a step toward restoring the balance, taking responsibility, and creating a life that reflects gratitude, independence, and purpose.

               I believe L&T’s Heavy Engineering Division offers exactly the kind of projects and engineering challenges I’m passionate about. My interests lie in Gas Turbines, Pipelines, Fluid Flows, and Turbomachineries, and I see a perfect fit in their Design, Engineering, and CFD specialization fields. These are areas where I can truly grow, leveraging my existing skills in CFD and Design, which I’m constantly improving, even if just incrementally. I’m eager to further this growth by attending the 40-hour CFD add-on course offered by ISHRAE and would gladly welcome guidance from professionals willing to share their knowledge.

Despite the common perception that securing a position at L&T might be easy for mechanical engineering students from my college, I’m determined not to be swayed by that. I’m committed to putting in the effort, refining my skills, and pursuing this opportunity with full focus. My primary goal is to enhance my logical reasoning abilities, as I often find myself feeling insecure about moments where I’ve made mistakes. However, I know that every misstep has taught me valuable lessons, and I’m ready to embrace the challenge. Why not L&T?
